# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SchemaBot is a declarative schema GitOps orchestrator for MySQL via Spirit and Vitess via PlanetScale. It makes running database schema changes safe and easy through GitHub PR comments and an Admin CLI.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
make build                # Build binary → bin/schemabot
make test                 # Run ALL tests (unit + integration + e2e)
make test-unit            # Unit tests only (fast, no containers)
make test-integration     # Integration tests (testcontainers)
make test-e2e             # E2E tests (docker-compose: local + gRPC)
make test-e2e-local       # E2E local tests only
make test-e2e-grpc        # E2E gRPC tests only
make lint                 # golangci-lint via Docker
```

**Always run `make test` (full suite)** to validate changes before a PR push when the scope of the change is unclear or crosses package boundaries. Only use `make test-unit` or `make test-integration` when you are confident the change is scoped to a single layer.

**Never assume test failures are unrelated to your changes.** Always investigate failures deeply — even if they appear in code you didn't touch — and fix them if possible.

**Detecting flakes:** Use `scripts/test-flaky.sh <TestName> [iterations] [package]` to run a specific test multiple times and confirm stability. Always use this after fixing a flaky test to verify the fix holds (e.g., `scripts/test-flaky.sh TestMultiKeyspaceDDLDeploy 5 ./pkg/localscale/...`).

**Never increase timeouts to fix flakes.** If a test is slow or flaky in CI, find and fix the root cause — don't mask it by increasing deadlines or poll timeouts. Common root causes: resource contention, missing cleanup between tests, container startup races, unbounded retries.

**Never skip tests in CI.** All tests must run in every CI job. If a test fails because of a missing dependency (Docker image, container, service), fix the CI workflow to provide it — don't skip the test. Prefer fixing underlying issues over shortcuts or workarounds.

## Test Architecture

Three test layers, each with its own make target and CI job:

- **Unit** (`make test-unit`, `./...`) — No containers, no network. Fast. Tests individual functions and packages with `-race`.
- **Integration** (`make test-integration`, `-tags=integration ./...`) — A mix of Docker containers (MySQL via testcontainers) and in-process server/gRPC components. Tests cross-package interactions without requiring a full deployment. Lives in `pkg/` and `integration/`.
- **E2E** (`make test-e2e`, `-tags=e2e ./e2e/...`) — Full docker-compose stack. All components (SchemaBot server, MySQL instances) are real containers — nothing is in-process or mocked. Tests the CLI against a running system. Lives in `e2e/local/` and `e2e/grpc/`.

Integration tests are the workhorse — most test coverage lives here since they're cheaper to run than full e2e. E2E tests are more expensive (docker-compose setup/teardown) but essential for validating the CLI against a real running system. Robust automated tests across all three layers are the only safe way to evolve SchemaBot.

CI mirrors local dev exactly — each job runs the corresponding make target.

## Git

- **Always verify the active branch before starting work.** The deployed code may be on a feature branch (e.g., a worktree), not `main`. Before implementing, check which branch has the code you're building on: `git log --oneline <branch> -- <relevant-file>`. Never branch from `main` for features that depend on unreleased work — branch from (or commit directly to) the active development branch.
- **Never bypass pre-commit hooks.** Do not use `--no-verify` or `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`. If the hook fails, fix the issue.
- **PR summaries should be concise** — a short paragraph or bullet list highlighting key changes and why, not low-level implementation details. Do not include test plans or checklists. Never reference internal company details (specific database names, staging environments, team names, internal URLs) in PR titles or descriptions — this is a public OSS repo.
- **Do not create PRs automatically.** Wait for the user to explicitly ask before running `gh pr create`. Pushing a branch is fine; creating the PR is a separate decision.
- **Create PRs in draft mode** (`gh pr create --draft`) by default. The author will mark it ready for review.
- **After pushing new commits**, check if the PR title and summary need updating to reflect the new changes. If a human has edited the summary, leave it alone.
- **Never squash after a human has reviewed** (comments or approval) — add new commits so reviewers can see incremental changes. Before human review, squash freely to keep the PR clean.
- **Upstreaming large branches:** Use the "leaf approach" — map the dependency graph of changes, peel off leaf nodes (changes with no downstream dependents) as small independent PRs first, ordered by topological dependencies. After leaves merge, the remaining bulk is smaller and more focused.
- **Never delete tests from other PRs when squashing.** Before squashing, diff against `origin/main` and verify you're not removing tests, functions, or code that was added by other merged PRs. If `origin/main` has moved ahead, rebase first to pick up the new code. A squash that removes existing tests is a regression.
- **Agent-generated issues:** When filing a GitHub issue, always include the agent name and model at the end of the body (e.g., "*This issue was generated by [agent name] ([model]).*"). **Only file issues when explicitly asked** — default to implementing the fix directly.
- **Copilot review comments:** Copilot auto-reviews every PR. Its suggestions are generally good — incorporate them when valid. But always verify they are contextually correct before implementing; don't blindly apply them. After addressing a comment (commit + push), resolve the review thread.

### Commit Checklist (MANDATORY — do these every time before `git commit`)

1. `gofmt -w` on all changed `.go` files
2. `go build ./...` passes
3. Ensure `~/go/bin/golangci-lint` is on PATH (built with the project's Go version)
4. `git commit` (NO `--no-verify` — EVER)
5. If hook fails: fix the issue, re-stage, commit again

### Pre-commit Hook (`scripts/lint-fix.sh`)

The pre-commit hook runs `golangci-lint` on staged Go files. It works in two passes:

1. **Auto-fix pass**: `golangci-lint run --fix` fixes formatting issues (gofmt, imports) in the working tree, then re-stages the fixed files.
2. **Verify pass**: `golangci-lint run` (no `--fix`) confirms no remaining issues. If issues remain, the commit is blocked.

When a commit fails due to lint:
- Read the error output to identify the issues (usually gofmt formatting or `usetesting` lint).
- Fix the issues in your code (e.g., run `gofmt -w <file>` for formatting, replace `context.Background()` with `t.Context()` in tests).
- Re-stage and commit again.

The hook uses `--new-from-rev` to only flag issues introduced by the current branch (not pre-existing issues in the codebase).

**Hook setup:** Run `make setup` to configure git hooks (sets `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks/`). This uses a relative path so it works in worktrees too. After creating a worktree with `git worktree add`, run `scripts/worktree-init.sh` to ensure hooks and tooling are configured.

## Guidelines

**Terminology:** NEVER use the word "migration" in code, comments, CLI output, or error messages. ALWAYS use "schema change" instead.

**OSS-ready code:** Never reference internal company names or proprietary details in code or comments.

**Engine-agnostic interfaces:** The engine interface (`pkg/engine`), tern proto (`pkg/proto`), and API types (`pkg/apitypes`) must not contain engine-specific fields (e.g., PlanetScale branch names, Spirit checkpoint details). Use generic `Metadata map[string]string` fields for engine-specific data. Engine-specific types belong in the engine package (e.g., `pkg/engine/planetscale/`).

**Never silently fail:** Prefer returning errors over silently swallowing them. If a function encounters a condition it can't handle, return an error — don't log and continue. Callers should decide how to handle errors, not the callee. The `Canonicalize` / `FormatDDL` functions in `pkg/ddl/format.go` are an exception: they are best-effort display formatters where returning the original string on parse failure is acceptable.

**Error early, never swallow.** Functions must return errors, not log and swallow them. A function that logs an error and returns void forces every caller to silently proceed as if nothing went wrong — this leads to corrupted state and subtle bugs. Patterns to avoid:
- `func doThing() { if err != nil { log(err) } }` — should be `func doThing() error`
- `if err != nil { log(err); continue }` in loops — return error unless the iteration is truly independent (e.g., polling different databases where one failure should not block others)
- `_ = someFunc()` — never discard errors; check and propagate them
- Background goroutines that cannot return errors to callers should transition to an error state (e.g., `dr.Error`) and return, not silently continue with partial results

**Wrap errors with context:** Always wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` instead of returning bare `err`. The context should include *what was being done* and *key identifiers* — not just the method name. For example, `fmt.Errorf("proxy query %s: %w", query, err)` tells you which query failed, while `fmt.Errorf("exec query: %w", err)` just restates the function name. Include the data that will help someone debug the issue from the error message alone.

**Info logging on critical paths:** Add `slog.Info` logging at key decision points and state transitions in critical-path code (server startup, request handling, background processors). Logs should include relevant identifiers (org, database, keyspace, branch) so operators can trace the flow. Don't log in hot loops or purely internal helpers — focus on boundaries and state changes.

**No silent branch cases.** Every `continue`, `return`, or early-exit in a conditional branch must have a log statement explaining why. Use `slog.Debug` if the case is expected and frequent (e.g., polling loops), `slog.Warn` if it indicates a surprising or degraded condition. Never silently skip work — someone debugging a production issue needs to see why a code path was taken. This includes:
- `if !ok { return }` after helper calls — the helper must log, or the caller must
- `if err != nil { continue }` in loops — always log the error before continuing
- `_ = someFunc()` — never discard errors silently; log them even if the operation is best-effort
- Fallback branches (e.g., "assume changed on error") — log why the fallback was taken

**No bug references in code:** When fixing a bug, write code and tests as if the correct behavior always existed. Don't add comments like `// this is where the bug was`, `// regression test for #123`, or `// without this fix, X breaks`. The git history has the context. Code and test comments should describe *what* and *why*, not the history of what was wrong.

**No "what changed" comments:** Don't add comments explaining what was removed, moved, or changed. Comments like `// Previously this was X, now it's Y` or `// The first progress poll transitions to the correct state` describe the change, not the code. If the code is clear without the comment, omit it. The git diff shows what changed.

**No PR/issue links in code comments.** Don't reference GitHub issues or PRs (e.g., `// fixes #147`) in code comments — they go stale and provide no value to future readers. The git history links commits to issues; code comments should describe *what* and *why*, not *when* or *which ticket*.

**No fragile comments.** Don't include specific counts, thresholds, external project names, or implementation details that will go stale when the code changes. For example, `// 100k rows` will be wrong when someone changes the count. `// uses the misk pattern` means nothing to someone who doesn't know misk. Comments should describe *intent* — the *what* and *why* — not restate the code or reference external context that may not persist.

**No `nolint` directives.** Always fix the underlying lint issue rather than suppressing it with `//nolint:`. If the linter flags something, the code should be changed to satisfy it.

**Instant DDL terminology:** In MySQL, "instant DDL" has a specific meaning — `ALTER TABLE` operations that only modify metadata (e.g., adding a column with `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`). `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` are **not** instant DDL even though they complete quickly. Don't describe them as instant in code or comments.

### SQL Parsing: TiDB Parser Requirement

All SQL statements processed by SchemaBot **must be parseable by the TiDB parser** (via Spirit's `statement.New()` and `statement.ParseCreateTable()`). This is a hard requirement, not a best-effort behavior.

- **Do not** add fallback logic (e.g., `strings.Split(content, ";")`) when the TiDB parser fails. If a statement cannot be parsed, that is an error that must be surfaced to the caller.
- **Do not** silently skip unparseable statements with patterns like `if err != nil { continue }` unless the error is an expected type-filtering condition (e.g., `ParseCreateTable` returning an error for an `ALTER TABLE` statement).
- Schema files are expected to contain valid MySQL DDL. If the TiDB parser cannot handle a valid MySQL construct, that is a bug to fix in the parser or Spirit, not something to work around with string splitting.

## AWS Infrastructure

- **Always deploy from the worktree you're working in.** The deploy script uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to resolve paths, so it builds whatever code is in your current working tree. Verify with `pwd` and `git branch --show-current` before deploying.
- **Always commit before deploying.** The Docker image is tagged by commit SHA — uncommitted changes are easy to lose and make it unclear what was deployed.
- **Never run `terraform destroy` directly.** Use `deploy/aws/scripts/destroy.sh` which requires explicit confirmation.
- **Always get user approval** before destroying AWS infrastructure, even when asked to "clean up" or "start fresh".
- Use the canonical scripts for all AWS operations. Two deployment layouts exist: `deploy/aws/` (single-env) and `deploy/aws-multi-env/` (multi-env with separate staging/production instances). Each has the same scripts:
  - `scripts/bootstrap.sh [-y]` — create/update all infrastructure
  - `scripts/deploy.sh [--skip-build]` — build and deploy new image
  - `scripts/destroy.sh` — tear down all infrastructure (always interactive)
  - `scripts/bootstrap-planetscale.sh` — bootstrap PlanetScale database (multi-env only)

## Go Style

### Testing

- **Always use testify** (`require` and `assert` from `github.com/stretchr/testify`) in tests. Never use raw `if err != nil { t.Fatalf(...) }` patterns.
  - Use `require` for preconditions and setup where failure should stop the test.
  - Use `assert` for verification checks where you want all assertions to run (e.g., checking multiple fields).
- **Use `t.Context()`** instead of `context.Background()` or `context.TODO()` in tests. This ties the context to the test lifecycle — the context is cancelled when the test ends. Test helper functions that need a context must accept `*testing.T` and use `t.Context()` — never `context.Background()`.
- **Prefer integration tests** with MySQL testcontainers over unit tests when possible.
- **No `time.Sleep` for readiness waits.** Never use a fixed sleep to wait for a server or service to be ready. Instead, poll with a deadline (e.g., retry a health check endpoint in a loop with a short sleep between attempts). For testcontainers, use built-in wait strategies.
- **All timeouts must hard-fail.** Every operation in test code must have a bounded timeout (max 30s for any single operation). When a timeout fires, the test must fail immediately with a clear error — never silently continue or hang. No test should ever run longer than 30s for a single operation. Use `context.WithTimeout` and `require.NoError` on the result.
- **Reduce duplication.** Look for opportunities to extract shared helpers when the same pattern appears 3+ times. In tests, prefer small composable helpers over copy-pasting setup boilerplate.

### State Comparisons

- **Always use `pkg/state` constants and helpers** for state comparisons. Never use raw string matching (`strings.Contains(strings.ToUpper(s), "STOPPED")`).
  - Use `state.Apply.Stopped`, `state.Apply.Running`, etc. for apply states.
  - Use `state.IsState(s, state.Apply.Stopped)` for case-insensitive, normalized comparison (handles proto prefixes like `STATE_STOPPED`).
  - Use `state.IsTerminalApplyState(s)` to check if a state is terminal.

### Imports

- **No re-exports or wrapper functions.** Don't create functions that just delegate to another package (e.g., `func FormatNumber(n int64) string { return ui.FormatNumber(n) }`). Callers should import the source package directly. Re-exports add indirection without value. Exception: wrappers that add transformation or special-case handling beyond a plain delegation are fine.

### Resource Cleanup

- **Database resources and Spirit objects** (`*sql.DB`, `*sql.Rows`, `*sql.Conn`, Spirit runners, services): **always** use `defer utils.CloseAndLog(x)` (from `github.com/block/spirit/pkg/utils`). Never use `defer func() { _ = x.Close() }()` — it silently discards errors.
- **HTTP response bodies**: use `defer resp.Body.Close()`. The `bodyclose` linter requires an explicit close on the response — `utils.CloseAndLog` doesn't satisfy it.

### Concurrency

- Use `wg.Go(func() { ... })` instead of `wg.Add(1); go func() { defer wg.Done(); ... }()`.
- For background goroutines that must outlive the request context, use `context.WithCancel(context.WithoutCancel(ctx))` to preserve context values (tracing) without inheriting the request deadline.
- Protect shared state with mutex: snapshot all fields needed from a struct in a single lock acquisition rather than multiple lock/unlock cycles.

### Database Connections

- After `sql.Open()`, always call `db.PingContext(ctx)` to verify the connection works (Go's sql driver lazy-loads connections).
- Always backtick-quote SQL identifiers: `` USE `db` ``, `` SHOW CREATE TABLE `tbl` ``.
- **Never manipulate DSN strings with `strings.Replace`.** Use `mysql.ParseDSN()` / `cfg.FormatDSN()` from `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` to parse, modify fields, and re-serialize. String manipulation is fragile and breaks on DSNs with passwords containing `/` or other special characters.

### Spirit Integration

- Use `status.State.String()` for Spirit state names instead of maintaining a separate mapping function.
- Use `utils.CloseAndLog(runner)` for Spirit runner cleanup instead of `_ = runner.Close()`.
- Use `table.LoadSchemaFromDB(ctx, db)` (from `github.com/block/spirit/pkg/table`) to load all table schemas from a database instead of manual `SHOW TABLES` + `SHOW CREATE TABLE` loops. Filter results with `ddl.IsSpiritInternalTable` when Spirit internal tables should be excluded.
- **Use `statement.New()` for DDL parsing** (from `github.com/block/spirit/pkg/statement`). Never hand-parse ALTER TABLE statements with string splitting — use Spirit's `AbstractStatement` which gives you `Table`, `Alter`, `Type`, and `Schema` fields. Use `statement.Classify()` for lightweight type detection without full parsing.
- **Use `ddl.ClassifyStatement()` for DDL type detection.** Returns `(statement.StatementType, tableName, error)` — handles the `statement.Classify()` boilerplate (nil check, empty results). Use Spirit's typed constants (`statement.StatementCreateTable`, `statement.StatementAlterTable`, `statement.StatementDropTable`) for branching. Use `ddl.ClassifyStatementOp()` only when you need the string representation for storage/API fields. Convert between types and strings at boundaries via `ddl.StatementTypeToOp()` / `ddl.OpToStatementType()`.

### Vitess Dependency

- This project uses a fork of Vitess at [`github.com/block/vitess`](https://github.com/block/vitess), branch `release-23.0`, with per-shard sidecar database support for vtcombo and a MySQL topology server for Strata support.
- The fork is referenced via a `replace` directive in `go.mod`. When updating, point to the latest commit on `release-23.0` (not `main`).
- The fork adds two features on top of upstream Vitess v23.0.3:
  - `--per-shard-sidecar` flag for vtcombo/vttestserver, which gives each shard its own `_vt_{keyspace}_{shard}` sidecar database — required for online DDL and VReplication to work correctly in multi-shard test environments.
  - A MySQL-backed topology server implementation for Strata support.

### Storage Schema (Self-Bootstrapping)

SchemaBot's storage schema is self-bootstrapping via `EnsureSchema` (`pkg/api/ensure_schema.go`), which runs on every server startup before accepting traffic. It reads all embedded SQL files from `pkg/schema/mysql/`, diffs them against the live database using Spirit, and applies any DDL needed. This means adding a new table or column to `pkg/schema/mysql/` is all that's needed — the next deploy picks it up automatically. No manual schema changes or ordering concerns.

### SQL Schema

- **Every CREATE TABLE** must use the canonical `SHOW CREATE TABLE` format that Spirit expects (see `pkg/statement.ParseCreateTable`): `ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`.
- Use `BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT` for primary keys.
- **No redundant indexes.** A single-column index is redundant if it's a left-prefix of a composite index (e.g., `INDEX (a)` is redundant when `INDEX (a, b)` exists).
