# Review Gate

SchemaBot can require PR approval before `schemabot apply` proceeds. This prevents unapproved schema changes from being applied to any environment.

## Enabling

The review gate is off by default. Enable it with the CLI:

```bash
# Enable globally
schemabot settings require_review true

# Enable for a specific repo only
schemabot settings require_review:octocat/my-repo true

# Disable
schemabot settings require_review false
```

Repo-specific settings take precedence over the global setting.

## How It Works

When enabled, `schemabot apply` and `schemabot apply-confirm` check for PR approval before proceeding:

1. **CODEOWNERS check**: If the repo has a CODEOWNERS file (checked from the base branch), SchemaBot requires approval from a listed code owner. Team slugs (`@org/team`) are expanded to individual members via the GitHub Teams API.

2. **Fallback**: If no CODEOWNERS file exists, any non-self approval satisfies the gate.

3. **Self-approval blocked**: The PR author's own approval never counts, even if they're a code owner.

4. **Fail closed**: If the GitHub API fails during the review check, SchemaBot blocks the apply and posts an error comment.

If the gate blocks, SchemaBot posts a comment listing the required reviewers and instructions.

**With CODEOWNERS** (template: `pkg/webhook/templates/review.go`):

```markdown
## Review Required

**Database**: `payments` | **Environment**: `staging`

*Requested by @alice at 2026-03-26 12:00:00 UTC*

Schema changes require approval from a code owner before applying.

**Code owners** (from CODEOWNERS):
- @bob
- @org/dba-team

### Next steps
1. Request a review from a code owner above
2. Once approved, run `schemabot apply -e staging` again
```

**Without CODEOWNERS**:

```markdown
## Review Required

**Database**: `payments` | **Environment**: `staging`

*Requested by @alice at 2026-03-26 12:00:00 UTC*

Schema changes require at least one approval before applying.

### Next steps
1. Request a review from a teammate
2. Once approved, run `schemabot apply -e staging` again
```

## CODEOWNERS

SchemaBot looks for CODEOWNERS in the standard GitHub locations on the base branch:

1. `.github/CODEOWNERS`
2. `CODEOWNERS`
3. `docs/CODEOWNERS`

The base branch is used (not the PR's head branch) to prevent a PR from relaxing its own approval requirements by modifying CODEOWNERS.

## Edge Cases

**Approval withdrawn during an active apply**: The review gate checks approval at the time of `schemabot apply` and `schemabot apply-confirm`. Once an apply is executing, there is no ongoing approval check. Withdrawing approval mid-apply does not stop it — interrupting a running schema change (e.g. Spirit copying rows) is more dangerous than letting it complete.

**PR force-pushed after approval**: GitHub automatically dismisses approvals when a PR is force-pushed. If `schemabot apply` was already run and a lock is held, `schemabot apply-confirm` will re-check the gate and block if the approval was dismissed.

**Reviewer leaves the team**: Approval is checked against team membership at the time of the gate check, not at the time the review was submitted. If a reviewer approved and was later removed from the CODEOWNERS team, their approval no longer counts.

**CODEOWNERS changes between apply and apply-confirm**: Both commands fetch CODEOWNERS fresh from the base branch. If CODEOWNERS is updated between the two commands (e.g. a team is removed), the apply-confirm check uses the new CODEOWNERS.

**Multiple databases in one PR**: The review gate runs per `schemabot apply` invocation. Each database's schema path is matched against CODEOWNERS patterns independently, so different databases can require approval from different owners (e.g. `schema/payments/` owned by `@payments-team`, `schema/orders/` owned by `@orders-team`). This follows standard CODEOWNERS path-matching semantics.

## Future Work

- **Server-side `default_reviewers`**: Configure required reviewers in the server config, independent of CODEOWNERS.
- **Unsafe change escalation**: Require additional approval for destructive operations (DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, etc.).
