# api

Package `api` provides the SchemaBot HTTP API service. It routes requests to Tern clients, manages a lazy client pool, and runs the background scheduler for apply coordination.

## Service

The `Service` type is the core of the API layer. It holds the storage connection, server config, and a pool of Tern clients keyed by `database/environment`.

```go
type Service struct {
    storage     storage.Storage
    config      *ServerConfig
    ternClients map[string]tern.Client  // lazy, created on first request
    // ...
}
```

### Tern Client Pool

Clients are created lazily on first request via `TernClient(database, environment)`:

1. **Local mode**: If the database is in the `databases:` config section, creates a `LocalClient` with an embedded Spirit engine. DSN is resolved via `pkg/secrets`.
2. **gRPC mode**: If the database maps to a `tern_deployments:` entry, creates a `GRPCClient` pointing to remote services that implement the Tern proto.

Lazy creation means a connection failure to one database doesn't block startup or affect other databases.

## Scheduler

On startup, the service launches a background scheduler (`StartScheduler`) that claims apply work from storage. A claim means selecting one stale apply and refreshing its heartbeat in the same transaction so the worker has a lease while it resumes the apply.

1. Runs immediately, then polls every 10 seconds per configured worker
2. Finds applies with stale heartbeats (no update for 1+ minute)
3. Claims one apply atomically by selecting it and refreshing its heartbeat in the same transaction
4. Gets the appropriate Tern client for the database/environment
5. Calls `ResumeApply()` so execution continues from persisted engine state

Stopped applies (user called `schemabot stop`) are **not** auto-resumed. The user must explicitly call `schemabot start`.

## Configuration

Config is loaded from `SCHEMABOT_CONFIG_FILE` (YAML). Key sections:

- `storage.dsn` — SchemaBot's internal database connection
- `databases` — Local mode: database name → type + per-environment DSNs
- `tern_deployments` — gRPC mode: deployment name → per-environment Tern addresses
- `repos` — Repository → deployment mapping

See the top-level [README](../../README.md) for configuration examples.
