// assertPlanStillCurrent enforces the cross-delivery freshness invariant for
// apply-confirm: the stored plan that the user is about to confirm must have
// been rendered against the same commit that is currently the PR HEAD.
//
// PR #134's assertSchemaStillCurrent helper closes within-delivery races
// (HEAD advances between discovery and execution inside one webhook handler).
// It cannot see the cross-delivery race: HEAD advances while the user is
// reading the posted confirmation plan, before they click apply-confirm.
// At confirm time both ends of the within-delivery comparison see the new
// HEAD, so the within-delivery guard passes — but the plan the user reviewed
// was rendered for the older commit.
//
// This helper closes that gap by comparing the stored plan's HeadSHA (durable
// record of "which commit did the user actually review") against the fresh
// PR HEAD obtained via FetchPullRequestNoCache.
//
// Caller contract:
//   - plan must be the stored plan record loaded for this PR+env+database
//     (typically the most recent plan from PlanStore.GetByPR, filtered to the
//     target env+database).
//   - freshHeadSHA must come from FetchPullRequestNoCache — the cached fetch
//     would return the confirm-time discovery SHA and defeat the comparison.
//
// Returns true to mean "rejected — caller must release the lock and stop".
// Returns false when the plan is still current and execution may proceed.
//
// Skip semantics:
//   - plan == nil: no stored plan for this PR+env+database. The cross-delivery
//     invariant cannot be evaluated; let the existing handler logic surface
//     the missing-plan condition. Logged at debug level so the branch is not
//     silent (per AGENTS.md "no silent branch cases").
//   - plan.HeadSHA == "": plan row predates this column. Skip rather than
//     fail closed during the rollout window so in-flight plans created before
//     the deploy do not suddenly reject. Logged at debug level.
//
// Both skip cases are deliberately conservative; see the PR description for
// the trade-off and the case for switching to fail-closed in a follow-up.
